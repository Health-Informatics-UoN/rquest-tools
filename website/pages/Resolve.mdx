# Resolve

The Resolve daemon polls the queue for jobs and executes availability and distribution queries against the database.
A result filtered by the obfuscation as configured for your instance is posted to [Relay](relay.md).

## Configuring Obfuscation
Two methods of result obfuscation are provided

### Low number suppression
There's a data disclosure risk if low numbers are reported for a given query, so low number suppression is applied to results, such that any result with a count below a given threshold will not be revealed.
Before building your Hutch tools stack, this can be configured in `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
resolve:
  environment:
# other environment variables
    LOW_NUMBER_SUPPRESSION_THRESHOLD=#Add your threshold here
```

### Rounding
After low number suppression has been carried out on Resolve queries, results can be rounded to the nearest *n*

```yaml
resolve:
  environment:
# other environment variables
    ROUNDING_TARGET:#Add your rounding target
```
